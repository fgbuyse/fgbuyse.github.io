About
======
As a geologist, I am excited by the potential of **3D textural and mineralogical characterization** to revolutionize our understanding of the formation history of critical mineral deposits. The accurate 3D
mineralogical and geochemical characterization is particularly of interest to petrological and genetic investigations of complex mineral deposits. 3D petrography has the potential **to grasp the missing information on the mineralogical and textural complexity of critical mineral resources** and enhance our knowledge of their formation history. However, important steps still need to be made _to incorporate this in the common toolbox of a modern petrologist (or by extension any specialist in materials characterization)_. My personal goal is to contribute to this change.
